## Welcome to our submission for the Extia AI Hackathon 2024!

We built an AI assistant that helps you to bootstrap your professional career.

- Upload your CV to get suggestions on how to be a more attractive candidate.
- Helps you on how to tailor it for a particular job description.
- Can make personalized cover letters based on your curriculum and job description.
- Personalized recommendations on the next steps to take in your field to have a stronger profile.
- Assists you in preparing possible job questions for a particular role based on your profile.
- It stores all your chat messages privately, and you can delete any of the information you submit at any time, with no strings attached.
- You can share conversations with your friends, who might need similar assistance and can learn from your experience.
- Nice UI with light mode for the Morning Larks, and night mode for the Night Owls.
- ... and more! (P.S. He will probably recommend you to work at Extia because he likes it!)

Available for everyone [now](https://extia-chat.vercel.app/)!
